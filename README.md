# claude-skins

A modern skin for Claude Code. A [mod](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/mods/overview) that
redraws the transcript: tool calls with icons and timings, edits as diff cards, tables and code as
animated cards, shell output in a terminal card, a spinner that shows what Claude is doing, and a band
above the prompt with your context and plan limits and a Compact button. Seven skins, light and dark,
a settings page, and your own agent can design a new skin with you.

These previews are drawn by the mod's own card code (`scripts/previews.ts`), not screenshots.

## Install

Needs Claude Code 2.1.287 or later, in a terminal or the desktop app's Code tab.

```
/plugin marketplace add hellosverre/claude-skins
/plugin install skins@hellosverre-mods
```

## What it redraws

| Site | Desktop app | Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| Tool calls | A line icon per kind, a spinning ring while it runs, a cross when it failed and a dotted ring when interrupted, lines changed and time taken | A node on the turn's rail with the same facts |
| Edits | A diff card: file, `+N −M`, the first lines changed, numbered, in green and red, and a Copy diff button for the whole patch; the alt text carries the patch too, capped at 4000 characters, with paths relative to the session (`a/` and `b/`) | Claude Code's own diff |
| Shell commands | A terminal card: status pill, output with stderr apart, long output folded, and a Copy button for the output | Claude Code's own output |
| Tables in replies | An animated card: header rule, zebra rows, swatches for colours, coloured diffs; Copy gives the markdown | A cell grid with a header band and zebra rows, and the same Copy |
| Code blocks in replies | A card with the language, line numbers and highlighting, and a Copy button | Claude Code's own markdown, and a Copy button |
| Spinner | An animated icon per phase: thinking, tool use, writing, waiting | The skin's word with a band of light through it |
| Above the prompt | Rings for context and each plan limit, a Compact button, and a nudge to compact from 70% context | Block meters and the same button, pressed with `c` once ctrl+x tab focuses the band |
| Turn footer | (not raised on desktop) | Time, tool count and lines changed |
| Your prompts | A rounded outline sized to what you typed; attached images stay below it | The same |
| The question dialog | A band naming its topics above Claude Code's own dialog | The same |

Every card rises in row by row, the last row starting within a quarter second of the first. Reduced
motion holds the icons, the cards and the band's rings still, whether it is the system's setting or
Claude Code's own Reduce motion, which also turns the terminal shimmer off. Each Copy button says what it
copies: table, code, diff or output. A skin only changes what is drawn: the stored
conversation, and what the model reads, are untouched. Agents, plan mode and the permission prompt keep
Claude Code's own drawing. The default skin is **noir**, black and white. Cards have no background of
their own, so they sit in the page. On a light Claude Code theme every skin switches to its light palette,
and a skin you made from a built-in keeps that skin's light palette. Every role in every skin reads at
4.5:1 or better on Claude Code's dark backgrounds, where the muted text was lifted wherever it fell short, and
on its light one, where the palettes derived from the dark ones are checked and deepened until they do.
On a diff, line numbers and `+`/`−` are drawn in the text colour so they stay readable on the tint, and
the band's rings are a faint track under a fill that holds 3:1 against it. With the `auto` theme it
follows your terminal's background (`COLORFGBG`) or, failing that, the system's light or dark mode, checked again every minute.
Set `SKINS_THEME=light` or `SKINS_THEME=dark` to choose yourself, for example when you launch with
`claude --settings '{"theme":"dark"}'`, which skins cannot see.

## Make it yours

- **`/skin`** opens the settings: pick a skin, see a live preview, switch the rail, tables, shimmer,
  band and icons, and repaint any colour. Repainting a built-in skin saves it as your own `my-<skin>`.
- **`/skin gallery`** shows every element the skin draws, numbered, to point at when you want one changed.
- **Ask your agent.** The mod gives Claude a `design` tool and a short guide, so "make me a skin that
  feels like a sunset" builds one and applies it while you watch.
- **`/skin <name>`**, `/skin list`, `/skin off`, and `/skin rail|tables|shimmer|band|clip on|off` for quick switches.
- **`/skin pin`** gives this folder a look of its own: later changes here stay here. **`/skin unpin`**
  returns it to the default, and **`/skin share`** makes this folder's look the default for the rest.
  Made skins are shared by every folder.

Your choices are remembered across sessions.

## What it can reach

It draws and remembers. It reads the session's directory, your context and plan usage, Claude
Code's theme and Reduce motion settings and the `SKINS_THEME` and `COLORFGBG` variables; keeps its settings in the mod store; registers one tool for your agent; and
compacts only when you press Compact, and copies only when you press Copy. With the `auto` theme it asks the system for its appearance once a minute (`defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle`
on macOS, `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme` on GNOME); it starts no other
process, touches no file and makes no network call.
Check it yourself:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

## Add a built-in skin

A skin is one file. Copy `hooks/themes/nord.ts`, change the colours and words, then add one line to
`hooks/themes/index.ts`.

```bash
claude plugin test
```

## Develop

```bash
claude --plugin-dir .
```

Saving a file reloads the mod in the running session. `/plugin-types` writes the type declarations
into `.claude/types` for your editor. `npx tsx scripts/previews.ts` redraws the README previews.
